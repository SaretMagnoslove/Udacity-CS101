# Question 8: Longest Repetition

# Define a procedure, longest_repetition, that takes as input a 
# list, and returns the element in the list that has the most 
# consecutive repetitions. If there are multiple elements that 
# have the same number of longest repetitions, the result should 
# be the one that appears first. If the input list is empty, 
# it should return None.

def longest_repetition(list):
    before, longest, most, repetitions = None, None, 0, 1
    for e in list:
        repetitions = repetitions + 1 if e==before else 1
        longest, most = (e, repetitions) if repetitions > most else (longest, most)
        before = e
    return longest

#For example,

print (longest_repetition([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1]))
# 3

print (longest_repetition(['a', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'd']))
# b

print (longest_repetition([1,2,3,4,5]))
# 1

print (longest_repetition([]))
# None
